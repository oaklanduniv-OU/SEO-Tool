  Naming convention:

  If a variable is used for a specific component: --{component}-{property name}-{modifier}

  Both {component} and {property name} should be kebab-case. If the target is the entire page,
  use 'report' for the component. The property name should not be abbreviated. Use the
  property name the variable is intended for - if it's used for multiple, a common descriptor
  is fine (ex: 'size' for a variable applied to 'width' and 'height'). If a variable is shared
  across multiple components, either create more variables or just drop the "{component}-"
  part of the name. Append any modifiers at the end (ex: 'big', 'dark').

  For colors: --color-{hue}-{intensity}

  {intensity} is the Material Design tag - 700, A700, etc.

    2. .lh-node (outerHTML)
    3. .lh-code

  With that sorted, the next challenge is appropriate column sizing and text wrapping inside our
  .lh-details tables. Even more fun.
    * We don't want table headers ("Est Savings (ms)") to wrap or their column values, but
      we'd be happy for the URL column to wrap if the URLs are particularly long.
    * We want the narrow columns to remain narrow, providing the most column width for URL
    * We don't want the table to extend past 100% width.
    * Long URLs in the URL column can wrap. Util.getURLDisplayName maxes them out at 64 characters,
      but they do not get any overflow:ellipsis treatment.
